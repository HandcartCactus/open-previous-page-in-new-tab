# Open Previous Page in New Tab: Firefox Extension
A small firefox extension. Adds a tab menu option to duplicate the current tab and hit the back button on the duplicated tab.

## Why?
You opened a new link on purpose, but it accidentally opened in the same tab. You did not want to leave the old tab, but you also did not want to lose this new tab either. When this happens (and it happens to me a lot), I usually manually duplicate the tab and hit the back button. This saves me a click or two.

## How to use:
1. Right-click on a tab
2. In the context menu that appears, click "Open Previous Page In New Tab".

## How it works:
1. Duplicates the current tab, putting the newer one to the left, keeping your current tab in focus.
2. Hits the back button on the newer tab. If there is no history, it only duplicates the tab.

## Installing
You can install the extension via the [Firefox add-ons directory](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/open-previous-page-in-new-tab/).

In the meantime, you can also download the current release. Visit `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox` in your browser and click the top-right button that reads "Load Temporary Add-on". Upload the zip file and you should be good to go!
